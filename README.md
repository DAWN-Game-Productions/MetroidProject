Prototype Build:
- Core mechanics

- 3 Different enemy types and behaviors
- Crooked Meter
- A single boss and boss mechanics
- War Gear/Weapons(4 different war gear[abilities], 3 different weapons) 
- Combat Mechanics


Expectations:
- 
Prototype[Stage 0]: The prototype of any game should focus on what the game needs to operate and function. Things like dialogue, story, art and level design are elements of the game we don't need to focus on until a later stage in the game. 
The core mechanics that must be established for this game to qualify as a prototype are: a few different enemies exhibiting different behaviours and combat styles, the core movement mechanics, combat input mapping, a singular boss + respective mechanic, and a rough picture of what the level should look like.

Beta[Stage 1]: The Beta or pre-Beta starts with the team resolving all of our known bugs or issues. Once we have solved our problems, we move onto our first step towards turning the prototype to a functional game. We increase the variety of weapons and abilities offered to the player, we expand the set of enemies and their behaviors(we can reuse behaviors and mix and match), 2 more bosses should be developed with their own unique mechanics and at least 1 entire section of the level should be completed. The new feature we will add will be the random event system. The beta offers the first real vision and set of expectations for our game, once this stage is completed, we need to all meet and discuss the future of the game(future involving everything).
